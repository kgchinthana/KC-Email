## Technology Stack
    ### Frontend (Client-Side):
      * React: The frontend of our CRM system is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables us to create dynamic and responsive web pages.
      * HTML & CSS: We use HTML for structuring our web pages and CSS for styling them, ensuring an attractive and user-friendly interface.
      * JavaScript: JavaScript is the primary programming language for our frontend, used for implementing interactive features and handling client-side logic.
        
    + Backend (Server-Side):
      * Node.js: Our backend server is powered by Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows us to execute server-side code. It's known for its efficiency and scalability.
      * Express.js: We use Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, to build robust and RESTful APIs. Express simplifies routing, middleware management, and request handling.
      * MongoDB: Our database is built on MongoDB, a NoSQL database that provides flexibility in data storage. It allows us to manage customer data, vehicle records, and more efficiently.
      * Mongoose: To interact with MongoDB, we use Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js. Mongoose simplifies data validation, query building, and schema management.
        
    + Deployment and Hosting:
      * MongoDB Atlas: Our MongoDB database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas, a cloud database service that provides robust data management and security features.
    
    + Version Control:
      * Git: We use Git for version control, allowing multiple team members to collaborate on the project simultaneously and track changes effectively.

    + Additional Tools and Libraries:
      * React Native: For the mobile application, we utilize React Native, a framework for building native mobile apps using React. This enables us to share code between web and mobile versions.
      * Nodemailer: Nodemailer is used to send automated emails and manage email marketing campaigns, enhancing customer communication.
